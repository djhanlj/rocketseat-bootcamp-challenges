# Challenge 2  - Github Compare App (Second React Module)

## Description
For this challenge, you should improve the app that was developed through the second module, by adding the following features:
* Store the repositories list on `localStorage`. In other words, if the page is updated or closed/open, the repositories list should keep the same.
* Create a button to delete each repository from the list and remove it from localStorage as well.
* Create a button on each repository to update its data by searching the new information about stars, forks, last commit, etc.

## How to test the APP
1. Install the dependencies: `yarn install`.
2. Start the server: `yarn start`.
3. Visit `localhost:3000` :nerd_face:.


### Skills
React, Styled Components, localStorage, CSS, Font-Awesome.
